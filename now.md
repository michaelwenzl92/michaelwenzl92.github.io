## Child Care

Life with an under-one-year old baby never gets boring - free time is a seldom blessing :)  

## Books

<ul class="books">
  <li>Implementing Domain-Driven Design - Vernon, Vaughn</li>
  <p>Beautiful refresher and in-depth dive into the principles first presented by Eric Evans</p>
  
  <li>Category Theory for Programmers - Bartosz Milewski</li>
  <p>One of the most abstract areas in Mathematics and also a topic that is perfectly compatible with software engineering</p>
  
  <li>Mathematik f√ºr Informatiker - Peter Hartmann</li>
  <p>Lately i fell in love again with Mathematics and therefore picked up this book again from the bookshelf. It collected some dust over the years, but still delivers in a great way.</p>
