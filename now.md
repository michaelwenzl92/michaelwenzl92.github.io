## Child Care

Life with an under-one-year old baby never gets boring - a free time is a seldom blessing :)  

## Books

* **Implementing Domain-Driven Design - Vernon, Vaughn**<br>
  Beautiful refresher and in-depth dive into the principles first presented by Eric Evans<br>&nbsp;
* **Category Theory for Programmers - Bartosz Milewski**<br>
  One of the most abstract areas in Mathematics and also a topic that is perfectly compatible with software engineering<br>&nbsp;
* **Mathematik f√ºr Informatiker - Peter Hartmann**<br>
  Lately i fell in love again with Mathematics and therefore picked up this book again from the bookshelf. It collected some dust over the years, but still delivers in a great way.<br>&nbsp;
